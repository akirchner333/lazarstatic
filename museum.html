        <div>The only form of interaction is reactions - no posts, only reactions and reactions to reactions. Started with three kinds of reactions (happy, sad, and neutral) and later added five more (crab, glacier, microphone, obelisk and shield).</div>

        <summary>6th Generation: Ply and Reply (October 9th - October 15th, 2022)</summary>
        <div>Users could "ply" posts, making an older post a reply of their new post. This allowed conversations to move both up and down and for disparate threads to be linked together. Lazar gen 6 also featured the complete scripts of Macbeth and the Tempest, converted into a social media feed.
