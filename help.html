			<span class="lazar">Lazar.social</span> is an ongoing social network project by Alexa Kirchner. Each generation of <span class="lazar">lazar</span> is a functional social media network, built on entirely novel design principles. We have barely begun to explore the range of interactions that can be done through a website - <span class="lazar">lazar</span> is an attempt to demonstrate what some of the weirder forms might look and feel like.
		</p>

		<p>
			Every generation of <span class="lazar">lazar</span> is temporary and will only stay up for a limited amount of time. <span class="lazar">Lazar</span> is currently between generations and therefore unavailable. Information about previous generations of <span class="lazar">lazar</span> is available in <a href="museum.html">the museum</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Announcements are generally posted on the <span class="lazar">lazar</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/lazardotsocial">twitter</a> while influences, background, and explanations can becan be found on <a href="https://lazardotsocial.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>. The source code for the last two generations of <span class="lazar">lazar</span> can be found on <a href="https://github.com/akirchner333/lazar/">github</a>.

		<p>
			This is all the help we have to offer at this time.
